# @reactiveField
---

This is a decorator that allows you to define a reactive field on the element.

Once an update is made to the field, it will inform the component that an update occured.

It plays well in combination with the @onUpdated decorator.

<CodeBlock lang='typescript'>{`@reactiveField numberOfClicks = 1;`}</CodeBlock>
