# @onEvent
---

This is a decorator that allows you to register event listeners on the element. 

It takes an options object with the target and type of the event and a method to call when the event is fired.

<CodeBlock lang='typescript'>{`@onEvent({ target: "[data-target]", type: "click" }) doSomething() {...} `}</CodeBlock>
