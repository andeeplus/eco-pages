Lite Elements is a minimalist web component library designed for simplicity and flexibility. 

It leverages the light DOM, allowing components to be styled and manipulated with standard CSS and JavaScript, unlike traditional web components that use the shadow DOM. 

This approach deviates from conventional web component best practices, offering a trade-off for a more streamlined development experience. 

Ideal for small to medium-sized projects, Lite Elements provides a lightweight alternative to full web components implementations, reducing unnecessary overhead for projects that don't demand the full capabilities of the standard.
