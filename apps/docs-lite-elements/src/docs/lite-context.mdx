# Lite Context
---

LiteContext is a lightweight class that permits you to share context with other components in a similar way to React's Context API.
It provides a simple way to create and manage data and methods that can be shared across the application.

It is based on the official [proposal](github.com/webcomponents-cg/community-protocols/blob/main/proposals/context.md#definitions) for a context API for Web Components.

It is a simple class that you can extend to create your own context provider.

Then you can use the `@useContext` or `@subscribe` decorator to register a subscription or use the context.
