# Lite Element
---

This is the base class for all Lite Elements. It provides a set of decorators that can be used to define the behavior of the element.

Please note that this class is not meant to be used directly. Instead, you should extend it to create your own custom elements.

You can use the `@customElement` decorator to define a custom element.

Go to the [Decorator Section](/docs/custom-element) to see all the available decorators.

<CodeBlock lang='typescript'>{`@customElement('lc-demo')
export class MyElement extends LiteElement {}`}
</CodeBlock>
