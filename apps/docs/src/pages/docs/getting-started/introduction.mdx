# Introduction
---

Eco Pages is a user-friendly static site generator, enabling you to craft static websites with ease and flexibility. It's perfectly suited for creating a variety of websites, including blogs and portfolios.

The primary objective of this project is to offer a straightforward and transparent approach to building static websites, leveraging the power of modern web technologies, without any hidden complexities.

The construction of this project relies solely on a select few dependencies, which are highlighted below.

Eco Pages is founded on [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and employs [Kita](https://kita.js.org/), [Mdx](https://mdxjs.com/), and [Lit](https://lit.dev/) as its default template engines.

For CSS, we've chosen to integrate [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in conjunction with [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/).

It's important to note that, contrary to Tailwind CSS's typical recommendations, we advocate for the use of `css` stylesheets with `@apply` directives when using Tailwind CSS with Eco Pages.

As this project is in its infancy, some rough edges are to be expected. If you encounter any issues, we encourage you to report them on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ecopages/ecopages).
